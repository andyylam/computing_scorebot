# ScoreBot for Computing Freshmen Camps 

Initially made at https://github.com/nexolute/telegram-scorebot, but personally cleaned up documentation and command helpsheet, and added features like addOg and addHouse so that admins don't have to manually edit the json file.
Commands:
help - Open a help sheet of commands 
ds - Display scores
addhouse - Add a new house.
addog - Add a new og.
addhousescore - Add score to a house. Command accepts two arguments, houseId and score, put behind the command with spaces. 
addogscore - Add score to a OG. Command accepts three arguments, houseId, ogId and score. 
who - get your User Id
addadmin - Add an admin. Accepts one argument, userId. 
reset - Obtain a .csv file of current points and reset all points to zero.
